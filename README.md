BE A QUALITY ASSURANCE ANALYST

Add the .equalTo() method to the Coin class

Use the MyArrayList and Coin classes to create a list of Coin objects.

Write a main for TestMyArrayList that thoroughly tests the newly created data structure. 
Make sure and test corner cases and think of ways to try to break the code. 
If you find a problem, double check the slides from class to ensure all needed changes already identified were completed.
If it is a new "undocumented feature" then document it, along with the test case (in your testing code base is fine) and submit it to the developers via your GitHub submission along with a suggested fix.
